Build a comprehensive garden data analytics platform that processes and analyzes garden data. This system needs to handle complex data relationships and provide detailed
analytics using nested components and inheritance chains.

Requirements:
• Create a GardenManager that can handle multiple gardens
• Include a helper GardenStats inside your manager for calculating statistics
• Build a plant family tree: Plant → FloweringPlant → PrizeFlower
• Include a method create_garden_network() that works on the manager type itself
• Add utility functions that don’t need specific garden data
• Show different types of methods: instance methods, class-level methods, and utility functions
• Each garden should track plant collections and statistics
• Use your nested statistics helper to calculate analytics
• Organize everything within appropriate structures - avoid scattered global functions

Consider how you might organize complex systems with multiple interacting components.
